# Automated Greenhouse using Arduino

## Overview

This project automates a greenhouse environment using an Arduino-based system. It monitors and controls temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light levels to optimize plant growth.

## Features

Temperature & Humidity Control: Uses a DHT11/DHT22 sensor to monitor and regulate temperature and humidity.

Automatic Irrigation System: Soil moisture sensors detect dryness and activate water pumps accordingly.

Light Control: Adjusts artificial lighting based on natural light levels.

Ventilation System: Fans operate when temperature exceeds predefined limits.

LCD Display & Alerts: Displays real-time sensor data and triggers alerts if conditions are critical.

## Components Required

Arduino Uno/Nano

DHT11/DHT22 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor)

Soil Moisture Sensor

LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)

Relay Module (For controlling pumps, fans, and lights)

Water Pump

12V Fan

LCD Display (16x2) with I2C Module

LEDs (For status indications)

Power Supply (5V & 12V as needed)

## Future Enhancements

Add IoT integration for remote monitoring.

Implement a mobile app for control and notifications.

Introduce machine learning for predictive watering and lighting adjustments.
